# Fadi-Calculator
Python Based Calculator 
FADI Calculator, a Python-based program that performs mathematical and physics-related calculations with a user-friendly interface. Here are the key features:

Features:

1. Mathematical Operations:

Addition

Subtraction

Multiplication

Division (with error handling for division by zero)



2. Physics Calculations:

Force Calculation (F = ma): Determines force using mass and acceleration.

Velocity Calculation (v = u + at): Computes final velocity using initial velocity, acceleration, and time.

Kinetic Energy Calculation (KE = 0.5 * m * v²): Calculates the kinetic energy of an object.

Gravitational Force Calculation (F = G * (m1 * m2) / r²): Computes the gravitational force between two masses.

Step 3: Calculate Force
Enter 1 to calculate force, and provide inputs for mass and acceleration.

Input:

Enter mass (kg): 10  
Enter acceleration (m/s²): 9.8

Output:

Using the formula: F = m * a
Where: m = 10 kg, a = 9.8 m/s²

Force (F = ma) Result: 98.0 N
